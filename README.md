# Book Recommender System (app no longer exists Heroku)
This repository contains the files used to create and deploy a simple Book Recommender app on Heroku.

"app.py" is the app file, requirements are required packages, Procfile to declare a process type.

The short1.csv is the dataset used for the app. It consists of 5% of the original book recommender system as there were memory issues trying to run the app using the entire dataset on heroku. The original data can be found in the zip file containing 3 csv files.

The Project1 Book Recommender Code is a notebook with the data preparation, model creation and evaluation.


The .gitignore file is hidden but the contents inside are:

venv, *.pyc, .env, and .DS_Store
